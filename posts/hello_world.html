<h3><i class="fas fa-code"></i> HELLO WORLD!</h3>
This is my first post. I started building a blog with Django but I felt it was a bit to much,
right now I don't feel like paying for servers etc. <br>
So a I figure why not make a static site, put it up on github and make a quick html-generator with python that I can run from the terminal. <br>
I guess there is a lot of static-site generators out there, but I just wanted something quick and simple.<br><br>

I'll get back to web dev in the future. but for now, this will be just ok!
